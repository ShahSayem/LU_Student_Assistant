It is a C / C++ project made by team: return 0. It is very hard for students to manage their regular study, tasks and updates etc. LU Student Assistant is a
console based program written in C/C++ language. It has a To-do list feature to handle this problem.
Here, Users can write, edit and see their to-do lists.People like me from outside of Sylhet also get a lot of
problems in search of accommodation. It also has a feature for getting accommodation, renting a
house.User can post their detailed posts and see their posts in the Accommodation feature. The program
also includes features to get Semester registration. Students can know here the tuition fees, other fees and
total fees (including waiver). They also can submit their semester registration request here. Users can
check their results for each semester by the Result feature. By using the Library feature, students can
submit a library membership request and can see the available books right now. Students can see other
